# Deployment

The Design System is a static site which is generated by
[Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and hosted on Netlify.

Netlify runs `npm run build` and deploys the contents of the `build` directory.

This deployment happens outside of GitHub Actions, which means that deploys
happen in parallel with the tests running. However, Netlify will only deploy if
the build executes successfully.

DNS for the design-system.service.gov.uk domain is managed via Netlify.

## Production

Whenever the `main` branch changes, the site is built and deployed to
design-system.service.gov.uk.

## Pull Request previews

Previews of Pull Requests are automatically published to a URL which has the
prefix `deploy-preview` followed by the identifier number of the pull request.

For example, pull request #137 would be deployed to
`deploy-preview-137--govuk-design-system-preview.netlify.com`.

The Netlify bot should comment on each PR shortly after building with a link to
the preview.

## Branch previews

When a new branch is pushed to GitHub a preview website will be deployed. Branch
deploys are published to a URL which includes the branch name as a prefix.

For example, if a branch is called `staging`, it will deploy to
`staging--govuk-design-system-preview.netlify.com`.

## History

### Hosting on PaaS

From launch until December 2023, the Design System was hosted on PaaS.

### Proxying on GOV.UK

We explored hosting the Design System on gov.uk/design-system by configuring the
Design System as a backend and route on GOV.UK's router.

This was abandoned because GOV.UK consistently does not use trailing slashes and
is [configured at the caching layer to strip them out][varnish-strip], whilst
the Design System consistently uses trailing slashes and nginx by default will
automatically redirect to add them (because that's how static sites and
directories with index files work). This caused an infinite redirect.

We considered changing the nginx configuration to match the behaviour of GOV.UK
but decided against it because:

- we would not be able to match this behaviour on other services we use, such as
  Netlify.
- it would break relative URLs.

We considered modifying the caching layer to allow the Design System to keep its
trailing-slashed URLs, but decided against it because:

- it introduced a 'special case' and additional complexity to GOV.UK's
  configuration.
- other parts of GOV.UK's infrastructure (such as their mirroring) make
  assumptions based on the lack of a trailing slash and relative URLs.
