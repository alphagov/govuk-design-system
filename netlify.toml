# A number of the examples in the Design System include <form> elements so that
# users copying the examples have something that requires relatively little
# tweaking to work out the box (in particular Prototype Kit users, for example)
#
# We have some JavaScript to prevent those forms actually being submitted but
# for users who don’t have JavaScript enabled (or who manage to interact with
# the form before the JS has run) it’s still possible to submit the form.
#
# Handle that gracefully by redirecting to a page that explains what has
# happened and what the user needs to do next.
#
# POST requests work just fine. Requires examples to be set up with an action of
# `/form-handler`.
