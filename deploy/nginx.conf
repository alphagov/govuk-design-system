# Unfortunately the staticfile buildpack has some limitations (e.g. it's hard to
# implement cache control because you can only add configuration to the location
# block) so we have to roll our own nginx configuration.

# A lot of this is based on the nginx configuration from the 'example' nginx
# buildpack [1] and the staticfile buildpack [2]

  # Disable absolute redirects
  #
  # The index directive (1) used in the nginx config within the buildpack means
  # that we send a 301 redirect when visiting a directory without a trailing
  # slash (e.g. /design-system will redirect to /design-system/).
  #
  # However by default nginx will use absolute URLs – including the hostname –
  # when redirecting, which means that users going to
  # design-system.service.gov.uk/components will end up being redirected to our
  # 'origin domain' (govuk-design-system-origin.cloudapps.digital/components/)
  # which is less than ideal.
  #
  # Disabling absolute redirects (2) means that nginx will instead 301 to the
  # relative url /design-system, which means users won't be redirected away from
  # the service domain and everything is A-OK ✌️
