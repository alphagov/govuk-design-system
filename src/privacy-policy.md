# Privacy notice: how we use your data

The [HM Land Registry Design System](/) brings together the latest research, design and development from across government to make sure it’s representative and relevant for its users.

To add to and improve the Design System, the team reviews proposals and works with contributors to publish new entries and improve existing ones.

## Why we need your data

For a number of the activities that we undertake to complete our function, we need to process personal data. The purposes are to manage and coordinate the [HM Land Registry Design System](/) and contributions from the community.

This includes:

- contribution process, including working with you on contributions, where you’ve proposed to add or improve part of the Design System
- support, including both the provision of support and responses to user enquiries
- feedback, including gathering it to improve our services, and responding to it, if you have asked us to
- community, which includes telling you about updates to the Design System, and how to contribute to the Design System and collaborate with the community, if you’ve asked us to

## What data we collect from you

We collect your:

If you sign up to our mailing list, we'll collect your:

- name

## Our legal basis for processing your data

The legal basis for processing this data is that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. This is because the HM Land Registry Design System brings together the latest research, design and development from across government to make sure it’s representative and relevant for its users.

## Performance analysis

We also carry out performance analysis to see how you use the HM Land Registry Design System and how well the site performs on your device during your visit — we do this to make sure it is meeting the needs of its users and improve it.

Where you provide consent, we collect the following information:

The legal basis for performing web analytics is your consent. You will be asked for your consent when first landing on the page. If you do not give it, you will still be able to use the page. If you do give it and change your mind, you can update your cookie settings.

## How long we keep your data

We will only keep your personal data for as long as:

- the law requires us to
- we need for the purposes listed above

This means that we will only hold your personal data for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 7 years.

If you have signed up to our mailing list, your email address will only be retained while you choose to remain on the list.

## Where your data is processed and stored

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.

Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom.

We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law — for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

## How we protect your data and keep it secure
We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.
