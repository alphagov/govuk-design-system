# Privacy notice: how we use your data

The [GOV.UK Design System](/) brings together the latest research, design and development from across government to make sure it’s representative and relevant for its users.

To add to and improve the Design System, the team reviews proposals and works with contributors to publish new entries and improve existing ones.

The GOV.UK Design System is provided by the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service/about) which is part of the Cabinet Office. The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office - a data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed.

[Read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register for more information](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053).

## Why we need your data

For a number of the activities that we undertake to complete our function, we need to process personal data. The purposes are to manage and coordinate the [GOV.UK Design System](/) and contributions from the community.

This includes:

- support, including both the provision of support and responses to user enquiries
- feedback, including gathering it to improve our services, and responding to it, if you have asked us to
- community, which includes telling you about updates to the Design System, and how to contribute to the Design System and collaborate with the community, if you’ve asked us to

## Our legal basis for processing your data

The legal basis for processing this data is that processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
