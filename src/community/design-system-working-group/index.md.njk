The Design System working group is a multidisciplinary panel of representatives from across government. It makes sure that all components and patterns published in the Design System are of a high quality and meet user needs.

The working group:

- reviews proposals and contributions against the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/)
- makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work
- advocates for the needs of colleagues across government

## Why the working group exists

By including representatives from a mixture of disciplines and departments, the working group helps to ensure that the Design System represents its users.

It means that decisions made are fair and unbiased, and that the Design System reflects the experiences of the whole of government not just one department. 

## Join the working group

Join the working group

Weâ€™re always looking for new members to help make the working group more diverse and representative of the wider public sector.

We usually bring new members into the working group twice a year.

In the meantime, if you are interested in joining the working group email the Design System team at <govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk>.
