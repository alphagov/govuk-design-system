The Design System is built upon the research and experience of teams across the whole of government.

The [Community Backlog](https://github.com/christopherthomasdesign/community-backlog-draft/projects/1) hosts discussion about the components and patterns in the Design System, as well as possible future additions.

Use it to:
- See what components or patterns are currently being worked on
- See examples of components or patterns that aren't in the Design System yet 
- Share feedback on how components or patterns are performing in your service

For more information on what the GOV.UK Design System team is working on, see the [roadmap](#).

{# Anyone can propose, develop or contribute to new patterns and components, or improvements to existing ones.

They can be:
- **Proposed** - someone has suggested a new component or pattern
- **To do** - the proposed component or pattern has been agreed and is ready to work on
- **In progress** - someone is actively working on the component or pattern #}
