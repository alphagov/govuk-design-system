## Help improve this page

To help make sure that this page is useful, relevant and up to date, you can [propose a change](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/edit/master/src/community/resources/index.md.njk) – read more about [how to propose changes in GitHub](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-content-change-using-github/).

We will accept proposals from resource owners to link to their resource if the resource is clearly owned, well supported, up-to-date and compliant with the GOV.UK Design System, the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) and the [GOV.UK external linking policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/links).

We're more likely to link to a resource if:

- It’s clear who is responsible for the resource and who isn’t 
- There is documentation explaining how to use, contribute to and get support for the resource
- Support tickets for the resource are generally answered within a month
- Production resources output the same markup as GOV.UK Frontend
- Production resources are no more than 1 month behind the latest release of GOV.UK Frontend
- Design resources are no more than 3 months behind the latest version of the Design System
- The resource doesn't produce services that are inaccessible, insecure or hard to maintain
- Linking to the resource would not give one commercial supplier an advantage over another
