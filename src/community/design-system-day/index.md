## Two days of talks and workshops

Design System Day is the GOV.UK Design System's flagship event!

It's a 2-day conference to collaborate and share knowledge about design systems with like-minded people, covering topics like accessibility, community and decision-making. It's a space for anyone using design systems in government to share ideas and developments, learn from colleagues, and spark conversations on related topics.

You can <a href="https://mailchi.mp/707ce8dec373/get-updated-by-email-govuk-design-system">sign up to our mailing list</a> to find out when we're running the next Design System Day.

## Speakers and sessions

All talks, workshops and sessions are suggested by the community.

Our speakers usually come from organisations across the UK and international public sector. We're joined by folks working on design systems from notable companies too.

## About the GOV.UK Design System community

The GOV.UK Design System <a href="/community/">relies on a strong cross-government community</a> to make sure it represents the latest research, design, and development work used in digital services.

To bring our community together, the GOV.UK Design System team regularly hosts events, workshops, and co-design sprints. Our team is always on the lookout for ways to engage users in different teams and departments to help strengthen the work we do, and to help to build better products.
