## A series of events throughout 2024

Design System Day is the GOV.UK Design System's flagship event!

It’s an opportunity to collaborate and share knowledge about design systems with like-minded people, covering topics like accessibility, community and decision-making. It's a space for anyone using design systems in government to share ideas and developments, learn from colleagues, and spark conversations on related topics.
