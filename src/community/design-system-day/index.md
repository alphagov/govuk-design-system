## Two days of talks and workshops

Join us for the GOV.UK Design System's flagship event!

Design System Day 2023 is a 2-day conference to collaborate and share knowledge about design systems with like-minded people, covering topics like accessibility, community and decision-making. It's a space for anyone using design systems in government to share ideas and developments, learn from colleagues, and spark conversations on related topics.

## Speakers and sessions

All talks, workshops and sessions have been suggested by the community.

Our speakers come from organisations across the UK and international public sector. We're joined by folks working on design systems from notable companies too.

### Day 1

The event is open from 9am and starts at 9:45am. There will be breaks throughout the day and an hour for lunch. Talks will close at 4:15pm and a social hour will run until 5:15pm.
