Anyone can propose a new component or pattern for the GOV.UK Design System.

Proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would [meet our contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/).

Follow the steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.

## 1. Check the list of discussions on GitHub

Check if someone else has already suggested your idea or something similar on the [list of discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/43/views/2).

If your idea is on the list, go into the issue page and comment on the issue. Say you need the component or pattern, and share any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.

If you'd like to work on it, read how to [develop a component or pattern](/community/develop-a-component-or-pattern/).

## 2. Raise an issue

If your idea is not on the list, [raise an issue](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/new). Once you do, [contact us](/get-in-touch/) so a member of the Design System team can review your proposal and add it to the list.

At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of the user needs. You can include screenshots or links to versions of the component or pattern in use, but avoid spending time working on a specific design or writing code.

Every year the Design System community [prioritises components and patterns to work on](/community/upcoming-components-patterns/). If your proposal is not prioritised, you can either start to [develop the component or pattern](/community/develop-a-component-or-pattern/) or leave it for someone else to work on.
