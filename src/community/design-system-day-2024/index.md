Thanks to all who joined us in Liverpool for this year's face to face event!
</p>

Our latest event took place on Thursday 5 September 2024 at St George's Hall in Liverpool. 200 members of our community joined us to hear [a wide range of talks](/community/design-system-day-2024/session-information) on this year's theme 'unsung heroes of design systems' from our brilliant [speakers](/community/design-system-day-2024/speaker-information). Each session was recorded and will be shared through [our mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/707ce8dec373/get-updated-by-email-govuk-design-system) in the coming months.

## A Design System "Hack" Day is coming

Join us for our third and final Design System Day event of 2024. We'll be hosting a hackathon looking at improving the journey between the GOV.UK Design System and other government design systems.

The hackathon will be hands-on with participants encouraged to work with others to ideate, investigate and prototype. We’re also hoping to have some lightning talks from colleagues in other government departments.

In-person activities will take place at the Government Digital Service’s office in central London. If you’re unable to make it in person, you can join the event online via Zoom.

Tickets will be released on **Thursday 4 November 2024 at 14:00 GMT**. We’ll let you know via our [mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/707ce8dec373/get-updated-by-email-govuk-design-system) and [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C6DMEH5R6) when tickets are available.

Tickets for previous events have gone fast, however we routinely see a 50% drop out rate for our online events. Please be responsible when securing tickets for our events. Please do not order duplicate tickets, and if you can no longer attend, please cancel your ticket so someone else can take your spot.
