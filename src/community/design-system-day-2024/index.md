## Join us for a Design System 'Hack' Day

[Tickets are now available on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/design-system-hack-day-tickets-1056506733079?aff=mcml) for our third and final Design System Day event of 2024. We'll be hosting a hackathon looking at improving the journey between the GOV.UK Design System and other government design systems.

The hackathon will be hands-on with participants encouraged to work with others to ideate, investigate and prototype. We’re also hoping to have some lightning talks from colleagues in other government departments.

In-person activities will take place at the Government Digital Service’s office in central London. If you’re unable to make it in person, you can join the event online via Zoom.

Tickets for previous events have gone fast, however we routinely see a 50% drop out rate for our online events. Please be responsible when securing tickets for our events. Please do not order duplicate tickets, and if you can no longer attend, please cancel your ticket so someone else can take your spot.
