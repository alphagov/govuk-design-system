### The value of performance analysis in design systems

Duncan MacGruer
1:30pm to 2pm

When developing a digital service, it's rare to think about how it actually performs. This is particularly true when we are dealing in fragmented landscapes with complex end-to-end user journeys.

To demonstrate why you should add a performance resource to your Design System, I'll explain how the Scottish Government is tracking captures, user interactions and real questions we've answered.
