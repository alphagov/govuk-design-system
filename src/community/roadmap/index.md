This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 8 December 2023.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.2.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.2.0) which includes the deprecation of the `useTudorCrown` parameter and an adjustment to our responsive type scale.

We've also:

- updated the components, patterns and styles to be compliant with WCAG 2.2
- made it easier for teams to understand [what's changed in WCAG 2.2 and what they need to do](/accessibility/wcag-2.2)
- made it easier for teams to [share their findings from user research](/community/share-research-findings/)
- run [Design System Day 2023](/community/design-system-day/)

## Working on now

We're:

- [updating the typographic scale](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/issues/2289), including increasing the minimum text size on mobile
- adding the [Password input](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/240) component to the Design System (thanks to Andy Sellick)

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- improve the way we organise technical documentation on the website
- start working on the next pattern, [Navigation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/76)

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
