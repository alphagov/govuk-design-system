This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 17 July 2025.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.12.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.12.0), which introduces a new mixin you can use to style the focus state if you’re building your own form input components.

In June 2025, we released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.11.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.11.0), which includes improvements to the Service navigation component, making it easier to use on mobile devices and offering a new inverse colour option. We also added deprecation warnings for code built with the LibSass library.

In May 2025, we released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.10.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.10.0) (and later fix versions) and [GOV.UK Frontend v4.10.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.10.0). These are the first steps towards refreshing the GOV.UK brand across government services.

## Working on now

We're carrying out research with services teams on how they are using the Design System and how they upgrade their service

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- apply a refreshed GOV.UK colour palette to all Design System components for a future release
- work on breaking changes for [v6.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/milestone/51) – we plan to include typographic scale enabled by default, iterate the navigation component and remove some deprecated features and options
- continue our JavaScript work and make improvements to the Character count component, Tabs component and Accordion component

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
- build new autocomplete components to replace [Accessible autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
