This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 22 November 2024.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.7.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.7.1) with updated department colours.

Previously, we’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.7.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.7.0), which includes an update to the Royal Arms in the [GOV.UK footer component](/components/footer/). We’ve also added new features to help services [create their own JavaScript components using GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/building-your-own-javascript-components/).

We’ve also recently:

- introduced a new [Service navigation component](/components/service-navigation/) and published a new [pattern to Help users to navigate a service](/patterns/navigate-a-service)
- updated the list of organisations and brand colours
- added a new feature to stop long words from ‘breaking’ out of components
- improved how the Breadcrumbs component appears on screen readers
- fixed some alignment issues with Radio buttons and Checkboxes
- introduced new features to help you include only the components your service uses

## Working on now

We're:

- making enhancements to the File upload component
- planning community events and activities for 2025
- doing research with services teams on how they are using the Design System and how they upgrade their service

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- work on breaking changes for [V6.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/milestone/51). We plan to include typographic scale enabled by default, iterate the navigation component and remove some deprecations
- continue our Javascript work and make improvements to the Character Count component, Tabs component and Accordion component

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
- build new autocomplete components to replace [Accessible Autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
