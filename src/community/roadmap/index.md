This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 10 October 2024.

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.7.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.7.1) with updated department colours.

Previously, we’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.7.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.7.0), which includes an update to the Royal Arms in the [GOV.UK footer](/components/footer/). We’ve also added new features to help services create their own components using GOV.UK Frontend.

## Working on now

We're:

- making the guidance around form design and validation easier to find
