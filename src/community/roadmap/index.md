This roadmap shows what we’re working on and planning to do.

Some things on the roadmap might change – the purpose is to tell you what’s coming up and help service teams prepare and plan their own work.

See our [GitHub team board](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53) for more details on our plans and day-to-day activities.

Last updated 4 March 2025.

## Recently shipped

We’ve released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.9.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.9.0), which includes a JavaScript enhancement to the File upload component to make dragging and dropping files easier for users.

We’ve also deprecated the options to show a service name, as well as navigation links, in the GOV.UK header component. Both options will be removed from the GOV.UK header in the next breaking release of GOV.UK Frontend.

Previously, we released [GOV.UK Frontend v5.8.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v5.8.0), which includes a new `ConfigurableComponent` class to help you build your own configurable components.

We’ve also recently:

- Added features to help services [create their own JavaScript components using GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/building-your-own-javascript-components/)
- Updated the Royal Arms in the [GOV.UK Footer component](/components/footer/)
- introduced a new [Service navigation component](/components/service-navigation/) and published a new [pattern to Help users to navigate a service](/patterns/navigate-a-service)
- added a new feature to stop long words from ‘breaking’ out of components

## Working on now

We're:

- planning community events and activities for 2025
- doing research with services teams on how they are using the Design System and how they upgrade their service

## Coming up next

We're getting ready to:

- work on breaking changes for [V6.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/milestone/51). We plan to include typographic scale enabled by default, iterate the navigation component and remove some deprecations
- continue our Javascript work and make improvements to the Character Count component, Tabs component and Accordion component

## Future plans

We plan to:

- [drop support for Ruby Sass and LibSass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2637) and [migrate to the Sass module system](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1791)
- build new autocomplete components to replace [Accessible Autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete)
