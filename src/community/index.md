Everyone can help improve the Design System by joining our community discussions, events and co-design collaborations.

We depend on a strong cross-government community to ensure the Design System includes the latest research, design and development to represent and be relevant for its users. Read our [community principles](/community/community-principles/).

## Join the conversation

Here’s a few places to join the discussions that help shape the Design System.

      <p>Tell us your experience using our components and patterns. Look for the ‘Help improve this page’ section at the end of each page to see its issue discussion, or <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues">see a list of all discussions</a>.</p>

## Collaborate and co-design

We’ve also formed cross-government groups to co-design new additions to the Design System. They’re open to everyone that’s interested in working with us.

### Maps in services

Help us explore best practices for the use of maps across the public sector so we can make them more accessible and consistent.

## Propose and help build a component or pattern

If you’d like to take a bigger role to bring a new component or pattern into the Design System, the Design System team can support you. The team can also work with you to ‘upstream’ something you’ve already built into the Design System.

Find out:

- about the [upcoming components and patterns](/community/upcoming-components-patterns/) we’ve prioritised and chosen to work on
- how to [propose a component or pattern](/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/)
- how to [develop a component or pattern](/community/develop-a-component-or-pattern/)

Learn how the [Design System working group](/community/design-system-working-group/) reviews and approves components and patterns to confirm they meet the [contribution criteria](/community/contribution-criteria/).
