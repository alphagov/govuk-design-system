The contents of the Design System must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, all components and patterns need to meet certain criteria.

## New proposals

To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.

        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.</p>"

        <p class='govuk-!-margin-bottom-0'>If it’s intended to replace an existing component or pattern, there is evidence to show that it’s better than the existing version.</p>"

The [Design System working group](/community/design-system-working-group) reviews proposals in the [community backlog](/community/backlog) to check they meet these criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be marked 'to do', ready to be worked on.

## Before a component or pattern is published

The working group reviews the implementation to make sure it is usable, consistent and versatile.
