Let users know they’ve completed a transaction.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'confirmation-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

You should use a confirmation page at the end of a transaction.

## How it works

Confirmation pages reassure users that they have completed a transaction and helps them understand what to expect next.

Your confirmation page must include:

- a reference number, if there is one
- details of what happens next and when
- contact details for the service
- links to information or services that users are likely to need next
- a link to your feedback page
- a way for users to save a record of the transaction, for example, as a PDF

### Help users who bookmark the page

Some users will bookmark the confirmation page as a form of receipt. You should allow them to return to the page, whenever possible.

If you can’t, make sure your service responds in a helpful way when users return using a bookmarked link. For example, if people use your service to make an application you could provide links to information on:

- tracking an application
- starting a new application
- what to do or who to contact if they have a problem with their application
