Help users provide an address using one of the following:

- Address lookup
- Multiple text inputs
- Textarea

## Address lookup

### When to use an address lookup

Use an address lookup when you’re asking users for a UK address.

### When not to use an address lookup

Address lookups generally only work for UK addresses. Use a manual option such as  multiple text inputs or a textarea when you are collecting mostly or only international&nbsp;addresses

### How an address lookup works

An address lookup lets users specify a UK address by entering their postcode and selecting their address from a list. There is also an option to enter a street name or&nbsp;number.

When using an address lookup, you should:

- make it clear that it will only work for UK addresses
- provide a manual option for people with international addresses or addresses that are missing or not properly listed in the address lookup
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without spaces

## Multiple text inputs

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'addresses', example: 'multiple', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### When to use multiple text inputs

Only use multiple text inputs when you know which countries the addresses will come from and can find a format that supports them all. This can be difficult to know if you’re asking for addresses outside of the UK.

### How multiple text inputs work

Using multiple text inputs means:

- you can easily extract and use specific parts of an address
- you can give help for individual text inputs
- you can validate each part of the address separately
- users can complete the form using their browser’s auto-complete function

The disadvantages of using multiple text inputs are that:

- it’s hard to find a single format that works for all addresses
- there’s no guarantee that users will use the text inputs the way you think they will
- users can’t easily paste addresses from their clipboards

If you use multiple text inputs, you should:

- only make individual text inputs mandatory if you really need the information
- make the text inputs the appropriate length for the content - it helps people understand the form, for example, make postcode text inputs shorter than street text inputs
- let people enter their postcodes in upper or lower case and with or without spaces

Make sure there are enough text inputs to accommodate longer addresses if you know your users will need them. For example, allow users to include a company name or flat&nbsp;number.

Royal Mail doesn’t need a county as long as the town and postcode are included. You should include an optional county text input so that people who don’t know their postcode can give a valid address.

## Textarea

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'addresses', example: 'textarea', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### When to use textarea

Use a text area if you expect a broad range of address formats and you don’t need to format the address for print or use specific sub-parts of the address (for example, street or postcode).

### When not to use textarea

You shouldn’t use a textarea if you:

- need to separate an address into accurate sub-parts (for example, street or postcode)
- need to help users look up an address

### How a textarea works

Textareas let users enter an address in any format and make it easy to copy and paste addresses from their clipboard.
