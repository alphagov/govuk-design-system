If you’re building a digital service, you’ll need a starting point for users on GOV.UK.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'start-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

If your service is in public beta or live, you must have a starting point hosted on GOV.UK. This will link your service to the rest of GOV.UK.

## How it works

Start pages include 4 main elements:

1. The service name: this should help people understand what your service does and whether they need to use it - [learn more about naming your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service).

2. A short introduction to list things that most users will need to know, for example, what your service will let them do or how much it’ll cost.

3. The ‘Start now’ call-to-action button.

4. A list of other ways to access your service.

This is a set pattern, so you won’t be able to customise it. 

### Testing start pages in discovery and alpha

If you want to prototype designs so you can test them with users, you can use the [start page template](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com/docs/examples/start-page) in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit-beta.herokuapp.com/).

### Get a start page for your public beta or live service

[Contact the GDS content team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-your-service-on-govuk) before your alpha assessment to discuss start points for your service.

The GDS content team will create a start page for you in most cases. If this isn’t the best way to meet the user need, they’ll recommend another way of joining up with the rest of GOV.UK.

GDS will only publish your start page when your service passes its beta assessment or self-certification and goes into public beta.
