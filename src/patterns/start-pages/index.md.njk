Use this pattern to test a start page in your prototype.

To get a start page for your public beta or live service, you need to [contact the GDS content team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-your-service-on-govuk) before your alpha assessment.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "start-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

If your service is in public beta or live, you must have a starting point hosted on GOV.UK. This will link your service to the rest of GOV.UK.

You can use the coded example here to test what works best for your users in prototypes.

## How it works

Start pages include 4 main elements:

1. The service name: this should help people understand what your service does and whether they need to use it - [learn more about naming your service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service).

2. A short introduction to list things that most users will need to know, for example, what your service will let them do or how much it’ll cost.

3. The ‘Start now’ call-to-action button.

4. A list of other ways to access your service.

This is a set pattern, so you will not be able to customise it.

Read guidance on [what information should go on a start page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/govuk-content-transactions) in the Service Manual.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "start-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, id: "default-2"}) }}
