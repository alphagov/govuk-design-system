Ask users to provide their National Insurance number.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "national-insurance-numbers", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern whenever you need to ask for a National Insurance number.

## When not to use this pattern

You shouldn’t use National Insurance numbers to verify a user’s identity.

Find out how to [protect your service against fraud](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/protecting-your-service-against-fraud#avoid-using-national-insurance-numbers-to-verify-identity) if you currently use National Insurance numbers to verify identity.

## How it works

Use a single [text input](../../components/text-input) labelled ‘National Insurance number’. Write it out in full and don’t use abbreviations such as ‘NINO’ or ‘NI Number’.

You should:

- allow for 13 characters as National Insurance numbers are spaced in pairs followed by a single letter
- allow upper and lower case letters and strip out spaces before validating
- avoid using ‘AB 12 34 56 C’ as an example because it belongs to a real person and use ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’ instead

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "national-insurance-numbers", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If the National Insurance number is not in the right format and there is no example

Say "Enter a National Insurance number that is 2 letters, 6 numbers, then A, B, C or D, like QQ123456C".


#### If the National Insurance number is not in the right format and there is an example

Say "Enter a National Insurance number in the right format".
