Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page types.

Patterns often use one or more [components](/components/) and explain how to adapt them to the context.

You should:

- use [GOV.UK Design System patterns](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/) first
- check [our backlog](/community/backlog/) for patterns that are being worked on
- check with the design practice for patterns that do not exist elsewhere in government
- create new or adapt existing patterns only when you can demonstrate existing ones do not work in your context
- share new and adapted patterns with the [community](/community/)

## How to get involved

Talk to the design system steering group to:
- get access to the patterns documentation we have
- find out how you can help
- get advice on what to do if you think you have a new pattern, or need one
