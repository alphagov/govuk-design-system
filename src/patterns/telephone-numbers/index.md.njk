## When to use this pattern

Only collect telephone numbers from people if you genuinely need them. Not everyone has or can use a telephone, so make sure you give users a choice about how they can be contacted.

## How it works

### Allow different formats
Users should be allowed to enter telephone numbers in whatever format is familiar to them. You should allow for additional spaces, hyphens, brackets and dashes, and be able to accommodate country and area codes.

### Validate telephone numbers
You should validate telephone numbers so you can let users know if they have entered one incorrectly. Google’s [libphonenumber](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) library can validate telephone numbers from most countries.


### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "telephone-numbers", example: "error-empty-field", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If the telephone number is not in the correct format and there is no example

Say ‘Enter a telephone number, like 01632 960 001, 07700 900 982 or +44 0808 157 0192’.

#### If the telephone number is not in the correct format and there is an example

Say ‘Enter a telephone number in the correct format’.

### Make it clear what type of telephone number you need
Use the form label or hint text to tell users if you specifically need a UK, international or mobile telephone number.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "telephone-numbers", example: "international", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Using example telephone numbers
If you wish to include an example telephone number (in hint text for example), [Ofcom maintains a list of numbers](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/information-for-industry/numbering/numbers-for-drama) that are reserved for use in media. These are:

- UK non-geographic: 01632 960000 to 960999
- UK London:  020 7946 0000 to 7946 0999
- UK mobile: 07700 900000 to 900999

### Explain why you need a telephone number
Tell users why you might contact them and when.

### Do not display telephone numbers as links on devices that cannot make calls

It’s possible to mark up telephone numbers as links, like this:

```
<a href="tel:+442079476330">020 7947 6330</a>
```

However, doing this will style telephone numbers as links, which is confusing on devices that do not support telephone calls, like most desktop machines.

It’s also not necessary - most modern mobile browsers automatically detect telephone numbers and display them as links anyway.

If you do need to mark up your telephone number as links, for example, to support a device that cannot automatically detect them, make sure they do not display as links on devices that cannot make calls.
### Write telephone numbers in the GOV.UK style
See the [GOV.UK style for writing telephone numbers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#telephone-numbers).

### Avoid input masking

Avoid [input masking](https://css-tricks.com/input-masking/) because it makes it harder for users to:

- type a number in their preferred way
- transcribe a number from another place and check that they’ve got it right

### Avoid reformatting telephone numbers

The GOV.UK Notify team have observed some users becoming confused when presented with a reformatted version of a telephone number that they provided, for example, with the +44 country code added.


## Research on this pattern

More research is needed on the best way to handle:

- international numbers
- extensions
- SMS shortcodes
