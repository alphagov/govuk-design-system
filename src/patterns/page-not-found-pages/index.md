A page not found tells someone we cannot find the page they were trying to view. They are also known as 404 pages.

{% set wcagCallout %}

{{ govukTag({
  text: "WCAG 2.2",
  classes: "app-tag"
}) }}

### New WCAG 2.2 criteria affects this pattern

To use ‘Page not found pages' and meet the new Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 criteria, make sure that users can successfully:

- [find contact information in a consistent way](/patterns/page-not-found-pages/#wcag-consistent-content-page-not-found)

See the full list of [components and patterns affected by WCAG 2.2](/accessibility/wcag-2.2/#components-and-patterns-affected-in-the-design-system).
{% endset %}

{{ govukInsetText({
  html: wcagCallout,
  classes: "app-inset-text"
}) }}

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "page-not-found-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, size: "xl", loading: "eager" }) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use a page not found if someone is trying to view a page that does not exist. This happens if someone:

- selects a link or button that takes them to a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address for a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address incorrectly

Test all links and buttons to make sure they work. Remember to [do the hard work to make it simple](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#do-the-hard-work-to-make-it-simple).

Make sure any web addresses in your service, letters, forms and on GOV.UK are for pages that exist or redirect to pages that exist.

## How it works

The page should have:

- ‘Page not found – service name – GOV.UK’ as the page title
- ‘Page not found’ as the H1
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should either:

- be a link to a specific page that includes numbers and opening times
- include all numbers and opening times

The content should be clear and concise, not blame the user.

<div class="app-wcag-22" id="wcag-consistent-content-page-not-found" role="note">
  {{ govukTag({
    text: "WCAG 2.2",
    classes: "app-tag"
  }) }}
  <p>You must always write contact information in a clear and consistent way across ‘Page not found’ and similar service error pages. This relates to WCAG 2.2 success criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">3.2.6 Consistent Help</a>.</p>
</div>

Do not use:

- breadcrumbs
- technical jargon like 404 or bad request
- informal or humorous words like oops
- red text to warn people

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "page-not-found-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, titleSuffix: "second", size: "xl" }) }}

## Research on this pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

- can fix the problem on their own
- understand what has happened
- understand the content and if there is anything missing
