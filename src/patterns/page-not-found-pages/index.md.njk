A page not found tells someone the page they were trying to view cannot be found. They are also known as 404 pages.

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use a page not found if someone is trying to view a page that does not exist. This happens if someone:

- selects a link or button that takes them to a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address for a page that does not exist
- types or copies a web address incorrectly

Test all links and buttons to make sure they go where they are supposed to.

Make sure any web addresses in your service, letters, forms and on GOV.UK are for or redirect to pages that exist.

## How it works

The page should have:

- “Page not found – service name – GOV.UK” as the page title
- “Page not found” as the H1
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need

Contact information should be either:

- a link to a specific GOV.UK contact page not a general contact page
- formatted like a GOV.UK contact page when there is no GOV.UK page

The content should be clear and concise, not blame the user. 

Do not use:

- breadcrumbs
- technical jargon like 404 or bad request
- informal or humourous words like oops
- red text to warn people

### If you do not know why the page is not found

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'reason-not-known', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

When a user submits the form, take them to a confirmation page which has:

- "We have your details and what you were trying to do" as the H1
- "We will email you when we have fixed the service" as the body content

### Service mistake

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### User mistake

{{ example({group: 'patterns', item: 'page-not-found-pages', example: 'user-mistake', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## Research on this pattern

More research is needed to find out if people:

- can fix the problem on their own
- understand what has happened
- understand the content and if there is anything missing
- would use a form to tell us about the problem and if that helps them
