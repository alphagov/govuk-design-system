Give users contact information within your service.

### New WCAG 2.2 criteria affects this pattern

To help users to 'Contact a department or service team' and meet the new WCAG 2.2 criteria, make sure that users can successfully:

- [find contact details in a consistent place across a set of pages](/patterns/contact-a-department-or-service-team/#wcag-consistent-contact)

See the full list of [components and patterns affected by WCAG 2.2](/accessibility/wcag-2.2/#components-and-patterns-affected-in-the-design-system).
{% endset %}

{{ govukInsetText({
  html: wcagCallout,
  classes: "app-inset-text"
}) }}

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "default", html: true, open: false, size: "s" }) }}

## When to use this pattern

Use this pattern whenever you need to help users contact your team or department. Carry out contextual user research to decide exactly where to use this pattern in a page or service.

Read about how and why to [set up user support](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/set-up-and-manage-user-support) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.

## How it works

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "all-contact-information", html: true, open: false, size: "xl" }) }}

Order contact channels based on what research shows your users need, and what your service or department can best support.

Show contact channels in the same order throughout your service. This helps users to find what they need more easily.

<div class="app-wcag-22" id="wcag-consistent-contact" role="note">
  {{ govukTag({
    text: "WCAG 2.2",
    classes: "app-tag"
  }) }}
  <p>If you repeat a particular set of contact details on different pages, show them in the same place on each page.</p>
  <p>For example, if you show a ‘contact us’ section at the end of one help page, any other help pages that include the same ‘contact us’ section should have them shown at the end of the page as well.</p>
  <p>This is to comply with WCAG 2.2 success criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">3.2.6 Consistent Help</a>.</p>
</div>

### Social media

If you have social media channels:

- list these channels last
- do not include a link to the social media sites you're using - read more about this in [GOV.UK’s external linking policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/links#linking-policy)
- tell users not to share personal information with you

### Write telephone numbers in the GOV.UK style

See the [GOV.UK style for writing telephone numbers](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#telephone-numbers).

### Explain any charges

Tell users if they might have to pay to use any of your contact channels.

For telephone call charges, link to the GOV.UK page on [call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges). Include the link after the contact channels list and opening hours.

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "default", html: true, open: false, size: "s", titleSuffix: "second" }) }}

### Give opening hours

Follow the GOV.UK style guide format for [time ranges](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#times) and [date ranges](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#dates).

Explain any exceptions, like bank holidays, or days of the week when your opening hours are different.

For example, ‘Monday to Friday, 9am to midday and 2pm to 4:30pm (closed on bank holidays)’ or ‘24-hour service’.

### Tell users how long they’ll have to wait

Tell users when you'll respond to them. This helps users choose which contact channel to use.

For example, tell users how long it'll usually take to:

- receive a response to their email
- get to the front of your webchat queue

### Inset contact information

Use [inset text](/components/inset-text/) to display contact information when you want to differentiate it from the content that surrounds it.

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "inset-contact-information", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m" }) }}

### Expanding contact information

If contact information is less important than other content on a page, you can enclose contact information inside the [details](/components/details/) component to avoid distracting users.

For example, if you need to provide contact information at the bottom of a form page for users who need help completing the form.

Only do this when there’s a lot of contact information to display. When there are only 1 or 2 lines, include the contact information within the body of the page.

{{ example({ group: "patterns", item: "contact-a-department-or-service-team", example: "expanding-contact-information", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m" }) }}

## Research on this pattern

This pattern was originally contributed by a team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). The team tested this pattern as part of a government campaign. They ran 2 rounds of research with 12 participants in total.

The examples and guidance here are based on patterns used by the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) and HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS).

### Next steps

Research is needed to work out:

- if users who are signed into a service need a different approach
- how to give contact information to users who need urgent help
