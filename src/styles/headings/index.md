Use heading tags, such as `<h1>`, `<h2>` and so on, to tag the headings on a page. Apply a heading class, such as `govuk-heading-l`, to style them visually. Style headings consistently to create a clear content structure throughout your service.

For a [question page](/patterns/question-pages/), or pages with long headings, follow the usual hierarchy of heading levels and styles associated with them. For example, `govuk-heading-l` for an `<h1>`, followed by `govuk-heading-m` for an `<h2>` and so on. In rare cases, you might want to alter how you use the headings hierarchy to achieve a better visual balance. An example of this is in [the design system's notification banner](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/notification-banner/success/) which uses heading levels in a different order to emphasise the most important information. If you do change the heading hierarchy in a similar way, it needs to go through accessibility testing before use.

Write all headings in sentence case.

{{ example({ group: "styles", item: "headings", example: "default", html: true, open: true, size: "m", loading: "eager" }) }}

If your page has lots of long form content, start with `govuk-heading-xl` for an `<h1>`, `govuk-heading-l` for an `<h2>`, and so on.

{{ example({ group: "styles", item: "headings", example: "headings-xl", html: true, open: true, size: "m" }) }}

## Headings with captions

Sometimes you may need to make it clear that a page is part of a larger section or group. To do this, you can use a heading with a caption above it.

{{ example({ group: "styles", item: "headings", example: "captions", html: true, open: true, size: "l" }) }}

If the caption should be considered part of the page heading, you can also nest the caption within the `<h1>`.

{{ example({ group: "styles", item: "headings", example: "captions-inside", html: true, open: true, size: "l" }) }}
