You can use the `govuk-section-break` classes on an `<hr>` element to create a thematic break between sections of content. `govuk-section-break` has class-based modifiers for different size margins.

By default `govuk-section-break` is only visible by its margin. You can add the `govuk-section-break--visible` class to make it visible with a separator line.
