Avoid unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

## Aspect ratio

### Photography

The aspect ratio for photographs should be 3:2.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "default", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}


### Illustrations or representative imagery

If your image represents something physical, such as a letter, document or credit card you should use the aspect ratio of that item.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "representative", html: false, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

## Alt text

All images must have an alt text. You should include a description of the image inside the tag to help users who are unable to see it.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "images", example: "alt-text", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

If your image is purely decorative and a description would be confusing you should still include the alt text, but leave it empty so it will be ignored by screen readers.
