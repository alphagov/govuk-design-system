## Screen size

Design for small screens first using a single-column layout.

Don’t make assumptions about what devices people are using. Design for different screen sizes rather than specific devices.

The default maximum page width is 1020px, but you can make it wider if your content requires it.

## Common layouts


### Two-thirds

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "common-two-thirds", html: true, open: true, size: "m"}) }}

### Two-thirds / One-third

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "common-two-thirds-one-third", html: true, open: true, size: "m"}) }}


### Row 1: Two-thirds <br>Row 2: Two-thirds / One-third

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "common-two-thirds-two-thirds-one-third", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}


## Building your own layout

If you want to build your layout from scratch, or understand what each of the parts are responsible for, here’s an explanation of how the page wrappers and grid system works.

## Page wrappers

### Limiting width of content

To set up your layout you will need to create 2 wrappers. The first should have the class  `govuk-width-container`, which sets the maximum width of the content but doesn’t add any vertical margin or padding.

If your design requires them, you should place components such as [breadcrumbs](../../components/breadcrumbs), [back link](../../components/back-link) and [phase banner](../../components/phase-banner) inside this wrapper so that they sit directly underneath the header.

### Add vertical space

Within `govuk-width-container` you should add the `govuk-main-wrapper` class to your `<main>` element. This adds responsive padding to the top and bottom of the page and will be the container for your main content.

### Exploded view of page wrappers

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "layout-wrappers", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

### Exploded view of page wrappers without back link, breadcrumbs or phase Banner

If you’re not using the [breadcrumbs](../../components/breadcrumbs), [back link](../../components/back-link) or [phase banner](../../components/phase-banner) components in your design, use a modifier class `govuk-main-wrapper--l` to increase the vertical space above the content.

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "layout-wrappers-l", html: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

## <a name="grid-system"></a>Grid system

Use the grid system to lay out the content on your service’s pages.

Most GOV.UK pages follow a two-thirds to one-third layout but the grid system allows for a number of additional combinations when necessary.

Your main content should always be in a two-thirds column even if you’re not using a corresponding one-third column for secondary content.

### Understanding the grid system

The grid is structured with a `govuk-grid-row` wrapper which acts as a row to contain your grid columns.

You can add columns inside this wrapper to create your layout. To define your columns add the class beginning with `govuk-grid-column-` to a new container followed by the width "modifier", for example `govuk-grid-column-one-third` to apply your desired width.

The available widths are:

### Full width

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "full-width", html: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### One-half

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "one-half", html: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### One-third

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "one-third", html: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### Two-thirds

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "two-thirds", html: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### One-quarter

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "one-quarter", html: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### Example combinations

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "combinations", html: true, open: true, size: "xl"}) }}

### Nested grids

{{ example({group: "styles", item: "layout", example: "nested", html: true, open: true, size: "m"}) }}
