The GOV.UK Design System helps service teams follow the [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles) and [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). This website also follows the [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) and [content design](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design) used by GOV.UK.

[Our accessibility strategy](/community/accessibility-strategy/) outlines our principles and work to improve accessibility within the GOV.UK Design System.
