Use this component at the top of a page to summarise any errors a user has made.

When a user makes an error, you must show both an error summary and an [error message](../error-message/) next to each answer that contains an error.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-summary", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

## When to use this component

Always show an error summary when there is a validation error, even if there’s only one.

## How it works

You must:

- add ‘Error: ’ to the beginning of the `<title>` so screen readers read it out as soon as possible
- show an error summary at the top of a page
- move keyboard focus to the error summary
- include the heading ‘There is a problem’
- link to each of the answers that have validation errors
- show the same error messages next to the inputs with errors

Read guidance on [writing good error messages](../error-message#be-clear-and-concise).

There are 2 ways to use the error summary component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-summary", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", id: "default-2"}) }}

### Linking from the error summary to each answer

You must link the errors in the error summary to the answer they relate to.

For questions that use a single field, for example the character count, file upload, select, textarea or text input components, link to the field.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-summary", example: "linking", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

For questions that use multiple fields, like the date input component, link to the first field that contains an error. If you do not know which fields contain errors, link to the first field.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-summary", example: "linking-multiple-fields", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

For questions that use multiple inputs, such as the checkboxes or radios components, link to the first checkbox or radio.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-summary", example: "linking-checkboxes-radios", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}
