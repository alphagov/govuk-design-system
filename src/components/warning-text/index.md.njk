## When to use this component

Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might&nbsp;take.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the warning text component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'warning-text', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

You might need to rewrite the hidden text ('Warning' in the example) to make it appropriate for your context.
