## When to use this component

Use the radios component when users can only select one option from a list.

## When not to use this component

Do not use the radios component if users might need to select more than one option. In this case, you should use the [checkboxes](/components/checkboxes/) component instead.

## How it works

Always position radios to the left of their labels. This makes them easier to find, especially for users of screen magnifiers.

Unlike with checkboxes, users can only select one option from a list of radios. Do not assume that users will know how many options they can select based on the visual difference between radios and checkboxes alone.

If needed, add a hint explaining this, for example, 'Select one option'.

Do not pre-select radio options as this makes it more likely that users will:

- not realise they've missed a question
- submit the wrong answer

Users cannot go back to having no option selected once they have selected one, without refreshing their browser window. Therefore, you should include 'None of the above' or 'I do not know' if they are valid options.

Order radio options alphabetically by default.

In some cases, it can be helpful to order them from most-to-least common options. For example, you could order options for 'Where do you live?' based on population size.

However you should do this with extreme caution as it can reinforce bias in your service. If in doubt, order alphabetically.

Group radios together in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a question, like ‘Where do you live?’.

###  If you’re asking one question on the page

If you are asking just [one question per page](../../patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) as recommended, you can set the contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

Read more about [why and how to set legends as headings](../../get-started/labels-legends-headings).

There are 2 ways to use the radios component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", titleSuffix: "second"}) }}

###  If you’re asking more than one question on the page

If you're asking more than one question on the page, do not set the contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. Read more about [asking multiple questions on question pages](../../patterns/question-pages/#asking-multiple-questions-on-a-page).

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "without-heading", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Stacked radios

When there are more than 2 options, radios should be stacked, like so:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "stacked", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m"}) }}

### Inline radios

If there are only 2 options, you can either stack the radios or display them inline, like so:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", titleSuffix: "third"}) }}

### Radio items with hints

You can add hints to radio items to provide additional information about the options.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "hint", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Radio items with a text divider

If one or more of your radio options is different from the others, it can help users if you separate them using a text divider. The text is usually the word ‘or’.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "divider", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Conditionally revealing content

You can conditionally reveal content when the user selects a particular radio, so they only see content when it’s relevant to them.

For example, you could reveal a phone number input when the user selects the 'Contact me by phone' option.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "conditional-reveal", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

Keep it simple. If you need to add a lot of content, consider showing it on the next page in the process instead.

Do not add conditionally revealing content to inline radios.

#### Known issues

Users are not always notified when conditionally revealed content is expanded or collapsed. This fails [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-role-value.html). We plan to fix this issue by the end of March 2021.

### Smaller radios

Use standard-sized radios in nearly all cases. However, smaller versions work well on pages where it’s helpful to make them less visually prominent.  

For example, on a page of search results, the primary user need is to see the results. Using smaller radios lets users see and change search filters without distracting them from the main content.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "small", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m"}) }}

Small radios can work well on information dense screens in services designed for repeat use, like caseworking systems. 

In services like these, the risk that they will not be noticed is lower because users return to the screen multiple times. 

### Error messages

Display an error message if none of the radios are selected.

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "radios", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If it’s a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question

Say ‘Select yes if [whatever it is is true]’. For example, ‘Select yes if Sarah normally lives with you’.

#### If there are two options which aren’t ‘yes’ and ‘no’

Say ‘Select if [whatever it is]’. For example, ‘Select if you are employed or self-employed’.

#### If there are more than two options

Say ‘Select [whatever it is]’. For example, ‘Select the day of the week you pay your rent’.
