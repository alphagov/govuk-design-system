{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

The panel component is a visible container used on confirmation or results pages to highlight important content.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "panel", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m"}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the panel component to display important information when a transaction has been&nbsp; completed.

In most cases, the panel component is used on [confirmation pages](../../patterns/confirmation-pages), to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.

## When not to use this component

Never use the panel component to highlight important information within body content.

## How it works

If you add extra content to the panel, to meet colour contrast ratio requirements use a font size of <code>govuk-body-l</code> for normal weight and <code>govuk-body</code> for bold.

There are 2 ways to use the panel component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "panel", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m", titleSuffix: "second"}) }}
