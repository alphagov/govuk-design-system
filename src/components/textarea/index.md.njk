## When to use this component

Use the textarea component when you need to let users enter an amount of text that’s longer than a single line.

## When not to use this component

Don’t use the textarea component if you need to let users enter shorter answers no longer than a single line, such as a phone number or name. In this case, you should use the [text input](../text-input) component.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the textarea component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "textarea", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "m"}) }}

### Label textareas

You must label textareas. Placeholder text is not a suitable substitute for a label, as it disappears when users click inside the textarea.

Labels must be aligned above the textarea they refer to. They should be short, direct and written in sentence case. Don’t use colons at the end of labels.

### Use appropriately-sized textareas

Make the height of a textarea proportional to the amount of text you expect users to enter. You can set the height of a textarea by by specifying the `rows` attribute.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "textarea", example: "specifying-rows", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "l"}) }}

### Don’t disable copy and paste

Users will often need to copy and paste information into a textarea, so you shouldn’t prevent them from doing this.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "textarea", frontendComponentName: "input", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, closed: true, size: "l"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.


#### If the input is empty

Say "Enter [whatever it is]".<br>
For example, "Enter your first name".

#### If the input is too long

Say "[whatever it is] must be [number] characters or less".<br>
For example, "Address line 1 must be 35 characters or less".

#### If the input is too short

Say "[whatever it is] must be [number] characters or more".<br>
For example, "Full name must be 2 characters or more".

#### If the input is too long or too short

Say "[whatever it is] must be between [number] and [number] characters".<br>
For example, "Last name must be between 2 and 35 characters".

#### If the input uses characters that are not allowed and you know what the characters are


Say "[whatever it is] must not include [characters]".<br>
For example, "Town or city must not include è and £".

#### If the input uses characters that are not allowed and you do not know what the characters are 

Say "[whatever it is] must only include [list of allowed characters]".<br>
For example, "Full name must only include letters a to z, hyphens, spaces and apostrophes".
