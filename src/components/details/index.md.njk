{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

Make a page easier to scan by letting users reveal more detailed information only if they need it.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'details', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the Details component to make a page easier to scan when it contains information that only some users will need.

## When not to use this component

Don’t use the Details component to hide information that the majority of your users will&nbsp;need.

## How it works

The Details component is a short link that expands into more detailed help text when a user clicks on it.

There are 2 ways to use the Details component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'details', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

### Write clear link text

Make the link text short and descriptive so users can quickly work out if they need to click on it.
