Let people select one or more options by using the checkboxes component.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "checkboxes", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m" }) }}

## When to use this component

Use the checkboxes component when you need to help users:

- select multiple options from a list
- toggle a single option on or off

## When not to use this component

Do not use the checkboxes component if users can only choose one option from a selection. In this case, use the [radios component](../radios/).

## How it works

Checkboxes are grouped together in a `<fieldset>` with a `<legend>` that describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a question, like ‘How would you like to be contacted?’.

If you are asking just [one question per page](../../patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page) as recommended, you can set the contents of the `<legend>` as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.

Read more about [why and how to set legends as headings](../../get-started/labels-legends-headings).

Always position checkboxes to the left of their labels. This makes them easier to find, especially for users of screen magnifiers.

Unlike with radios, users can select multiple options from a list of checkboxes. Do not assume that users will know how many options they can select based on the visual difference between radios and checkboxes alone. 

If needed, add a hint explaining this, for example, 'Select all that apply'.

There are 2 ways to use the checkboxes component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "checkboxes", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m", id: "default-2"}) }}

### Checkbox items with hints

You can add hints to checkbox items to provide additional information about the options.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "checkboxes", example: "hint", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Conditionally revealing content

You can add conditionally revealing content to checkboxes, so users only see content when it’s relevant to them. For example, you could reveal a phone number input only when a user chooses to be contacted by phone.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "checkboxes", example: "conditional-reveal", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

Keep it simple - if you need to add a lot of content, consider showing it on the next page in the process instead.

### Error messages

Error messages should be styled like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "checkboxes", example: "error", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](/components/error-message/) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

#### If nothing is selected and the question has options in it

Say ‘Select if [whatever it is]’.<br>
For example, ‘Select if you are British, Irish or a citizen of a different country’.

#### If nothing is selected and the question does not have options in it

Say ‘Select [whatever it is]’.<br>
For example, ‘Select your nationality or nationalities’.
