Use the fieldset component to group related form inputs.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'fieldset', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the fieldset component when you need to show a relationship between multiple form inputs. For example, you may need to group a set of text inputs into a single fieldset when [asking for an address](../../patterns/addresses).

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'fieldset', example: 'address-group', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

If you’re using the examples or macros for [radios](../radios), [checkboxes](../checkboxes) or [date input](../date-input), the fieldset will already be included.

## How it works

The first element inside a fieldset must be a `legend` which describes the group of inputs. This could be a question, such as ‘What is your current address?’ or a statement like ‘Personal details’.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'fieldset', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

On [question pages](../../patterns/question-pages) containing a group of inputs, including the question as the legend helps users of screenreaders to understand that the inputs are all related to that&nbsp;question.

Include any general help text which is important for filling in the form and can’t be written as [hint text](../../components/text-input#using-hint-text) in the legend, but try to keep it as concise as possible.
