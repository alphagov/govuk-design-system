Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.

{{ wcagCallout({
  type: "component",
  introAction: "use the",
  name: "Phase banner",
  criteria: [
    {
      text: "see all page content when a phase banner is shown",
      anchor: "wcag-do-not-cover-content"
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ example({ group: "components", item: "phase-banner", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, loading: "eager" }) }}

## When to use this component

Services hosted on a service.gov.uk domain must use the phase banner until they pass a live assessment.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the phase banner component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

Use an alpha banner when your service is in alpha, and a beta banner if your service is in private or public beta.

Show the Phase banner directly under either:

- the [Service navigation component](/components/service-navigation/)
- the [GOV.UK header component](/components/header/) and its blue colour bar (if your service does not use the Service navigation component)

Phase banners are shown across all pages of a service, so users should understand it as a service-level message.

You can choose to place the Phase banner in a more appropriate place for your service, however you’ll need to customise the component and provide your own CSS code to make it show correctly.

{% call wcagNote({id: "wcag-do-not-cover-content"}) %}

<p>Do not make the phase banner ‘sticky’ to the top of the page by using `position: fixed` or any other method. This is to make sure it does not cover or obscure any content which has a focus applied. This is to comply with WCAG 2.2 success criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">2.4.11 Focus not obscured (minimum)</a>.</p>
{% endcall %}

### Add a feedback link

Use a ‘feedback’ link to collect on-page feedback about your service. This can open an email or take the user to a dedicated page or form.

{{ example({ group: "components", item: "phase-banner", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, titleSuffix: "second" }) }}

{{ example({ group: "components", item: "phase-banner", example: "beta", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false }) }}

Whatever option you use, make sure that users do not lose their place in the service and can return to the page they were on.

[Find out what feedback you need to collect at each phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction#user-satisfaction-through-each-service-phase) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.
