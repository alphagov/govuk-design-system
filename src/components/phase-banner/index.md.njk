Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'phase-banner', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

You must use the phase banner component if your service is still being developed and is hosted on the service.gov.uk subdomain.
Use an alpha banner when your service is in alpha, and a beta banner if your service is in private or public beta.

## How it works

Your banner must be directly under the black GOV.UK header and colour bar.

There are 2 ways to use the phase banner component. You can use HTML or, if you are using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'phase-banner', example: 'default', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true}) }}

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'phase-banner', example: 'beta', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Add a feedback link

Use a ‘feedback’ link to collect on-page feedback about your service. This can open an email or take the user to a dedicated page or form. Whatever option you use, make sure that users don’t lose their place in the service and can return to the page they were on.

Find out what [feedback you need to collect at each phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction#user-satisfaction-through-each-service-phase) in the Service Manual.
