Use an error message when there is a validation error. Explain what went wrong and how to fix it.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-message", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "m"}) }}

## When to use this component

Show an error message next to the field and in the [error summary](../error-summary/) when there is a validation error.

Use standard messages for different components.

Try to [design your service to be easy to use and understand so someone never sees an error message](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure).

## When not to use this component

Only display an error when someone tries to move to the next part of the service. Do not show error messages:

- when users select or tab to a field
- as they are typing
- when they move away from a field

Do not use error messages to tell users that they are not eligible or do not have permission to do something. Instead, take them to a screen that:

- explains why we cannot accept the entry or selection
- tells them what to do next
- includes a way to leave the transaction

## How it works

For each error:

- put the message in red after the question text and hint text
- use a red border to visually connect the message and the question it belongs to
- if the error relates to specific text fields within the question, give these a red border as well

Summarise all errors at the top of the page the user is on using an [error summary](../error-summary/).

There are 2 ways to use the error message component. You can use HTML or, if you are using Nunjucks or the GOV.UK Prototype Kit, you can use the Nunjucks macro.

### Legend

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-message", example: "legend", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "m"}) }}

### Label

{{ example({group: "components", item: "error-message", example: "label", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### Be clear and concise

Describe what has happened and tell them how to fix it. The message must be in plain English, use positive language and get to the point.

Do not use:

- technical jargon like ‘form post error’, ‘unspecified error’ and ‘error 0x0000000643’
- words like ‘forbidden’, ‘illegal’, ‘you forgot’ and ‘prohibited’
- ‘please’ because it implies a choice
- ‘sorry’ because it does not help fix the problem
- ‘valid’ and ‘invalid’ because they do not add anything to the message
- humourous, informal language like ‘oops’

Above all, aim for clarity.

Read the message out loud to see if it sounds like something you would say.

### Be consistent

Use the same message next to the field and in the [error summary](../error-summary/) so they:

- look, sound and mean the same
- make sense out of context
- reduce the cognitive effort needed to understand what has happened

Use the question or form label in the error to provide context. For example, ‘Enter how many hours you work a week’ for ‘How many hours do you work a week?’

### Be specific

General errors are not helpful to everyone. They do not make sense out of context. Avoid messages like:

- ‘An error occurred’
- ‘Answer the question’
- ‘Select an option’
- ‘Fill in the field’
- ‘This field is required’

Different errors need different messages. For example, text fields may be:

- empty
- too long
- too short
- using characters that are not allowed
- in the wrong format

An error for a specific situation is more helpful. It will tell someone what has happened and how to fix it.

### Use instructions and descriptions

Some errors work better as instructions and some work better as descriptions. For example:

- ‘Enter your first name’ is clearer, more direct and natural than ‘First name must have an entry’
- ‘Enter a first name that is 35 characters or less’ is wordier, less direct and natural than ‘First name must be 35 characters or less’
- ‘Enter a date after 31 August 2017 for when you started the course’ is wordier, less direct and natural than ‘Date you started the course must be after 31 August 2017’

Use both instructions and descriptions, but use them consistently. For example, use an instruction for empty fields like ‘Enter your name’, but a description like ‘Name must be 35 characters or less’ for entries that are too long.

### Track errors

Find out how often people see them. This will let you:

- improve content
- A/B test variations
- redesign a journey

### Browser testing

The error message component has been tested with the following browsers and devices:

- Google Chrome 67 on MacOS
- Google Chrome 67 on Windows
- Firefox 61 on MacOS (including tests with custom colors)
- Firefox 61 on Windows
- Safari 11.1
- Edge 17
- iOS Safari 11
- iOS Chrome 63
- Google Chrome 67 on Android
- Samsung Internet 7.2 on Android
- Internet Explorer 11
- Internet Explorer 10
- Internet Explorer 9
- Internet Explorer 8

### Testing with assistive technologies

The error message component has been tested with the following assistive technologies:

- JAWS 16 and 18 on Internet Explorer 11
- NVDA 2017 on Firefox 61
- VoiceOver on Safari 11.1
- VoiceOver on iOS Safari 11
- ZoomText 10.1 on Internet Explorer 11
- Dragon NaturallySpeaking 15.3 on Internet Explorer 11

## Research on this component

Error messages designed using this guidance have been tested with all types of users in live services, including tax credits.

Research showed users:

- understood what went wrong
- knew how to fix the problem
- were able to recover from the error
