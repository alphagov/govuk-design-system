The GOV.UK header shows users that they are on GOV.UK and which service they are using.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'header', example: 'default', id: 'default-1', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

You must use the GOV.UK header at the top of every page if your service is being hosted on one of these domains:

- gov.uk/myservice
- myservice.service.gov.uk
- myblog.blog.gov.uk

## When not to use this component

You must not use the GOV.UK header if your service is not being hosted on one of the above domains.


## How it works

### Default header

Use the default header if your service has 5 pages or fewer.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'header', example: 'default', id: 'default-2', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Header with service name

Use the header with a service name if your service is more than 5 pages long - this can help users understand which service they are using.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'header', example: 'with-service-name', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Header with service name and navigation

Use the header with navigation if you need to include basic navigation, contact or account management links.

{{ example({group: 'components', item: 'header', example: 'with-service-name-and-navigation', html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}
