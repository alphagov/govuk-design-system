Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

You can use individual components in many different [patterns](/patterns/) and contexts. For example, you can use the [text input](/components/text-input/) component to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someoneâ€™s name.

Each component in the GOV.UK Design System has coded examples. If you're using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit][govuk_prototype_kit], or have included [GOV.UK Frontend][govuk_frontend_design_system] in your build, coded examples will render the same as in the Design System.

The GOV.UK Design System's code is public and freely available under a [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). You can [find our code repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/govuk-design-system-team), where we [code in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/).
