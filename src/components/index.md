Components are reusable parts of a user interface. Using pre-built, core elements allows government teams to build consistent services.

You can also use the individual components in [different patterns](/patterns/) and contexts. For example, you can use the [Text input component](/components/text-input/) to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someoneâ€™s name.

Each component in the GOV.UK Design System has guidance on its use and coded examples. If you're using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk), or have included [GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/) in your build, coded examples will render the same as in the Design System.

The GOV.UK Design System's code is public and freely available under a [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). You can [find our code repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/govuk-design-system-team), where we [code in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/).
