## When to use this component

Use the text input component when you need to let users enter text that’s no longer than a single line, such as their name or phone number.

## When not to use this component

Don’t use the text input component if you need to let users enter longer answers that might span multiple lines. In this case, you should use the [textarea](../textarea) component.

## How it works

There are 2 ways to use the text input component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "text-input", frontendComponentName: "input", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: true, size: "s"}) }}

### Label text inputs

All text inputs must have visible labels; placeholder text is not an acceptable replacement for a label as it vanishes when users click on the text input.

Labels should be aligned above the text input they refer to. They should be short, direct and written in sentence case. Don’t use colons at the end of labels.

### Use appropriately-sized text inputs

Help users understand what they should enter by making text inputs the right size for the content they’re intended for.

By default, the width of text inputs is fluid and will fit the full width of the container they are placed into.

If you want to make the input smaller, you can either use a fixed width input, or use the width override classes to create a smaller, fluid width input.

#### Fixed width inputs

Use fixed width inputs for content that has a specific, known length. Postcode inputs should be postcode-sized, telephone number inputs should be telephone number-sized.

On fixed width inputs, the width will remain fixed on all screens unless it is wider than the viewport, in which case it will shrink to fit.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "text-input", frontendComponentName: "input", example: "input-fixed-width", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "l"}) }}

#### Fluid width inputs

Use the width override classes to reduce the width of an input in relation to its parent container, for example, to two-thirds.

Fluid width inputs will resize with the viewport.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "text-input", frontendComponentName: "input", example: "input-fluid-width", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl"}) }}

### Using hint text

Use hint for help that’s relevant to the majority of users - like how their information will be used, or where to find it.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "text-input", frontendComponentName: "input", example: "input-hint-text", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s"}) }}

### Don’t disable copy and paste

Users often need to copy and paste information into a text input, so you shouldn’t prevent them from doing this.
