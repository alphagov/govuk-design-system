The GOV.UK guide explains how to create prototypes using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Before you start

To make prototypes you will need to install version 7 or later of the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/create-new-prototype) which has been built to work with the Design System.

## Using the HM Land Registry components

Using the latest prototype kit as a base, install the HM Land Registry frontend styles and templates:

```sh
npm install @hmlr/frontend
```

You can now import and use the HM Land Registry components in your prototype just as you can with the GOV.UK ones.

Example code can be found in the [components](/components/) section.
