The GOV.UK guide explains how to create prototypes using the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Prototype Kit.

## Before you start

To make prototypes use the link below to navigate to the GOV.UK setup guide.

[GOV.UK Prototyping setup guide](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/prototyping/).

[Build a basic prototype](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/start) using the GDS Prototype Kit.

## Using the HM Land Registry components

Using the latest prototype kit as a base, install the HM Land Registry frontend styles and templates:

```sh
npm install @hmlr/frontend
```

You can now import and use the HM Land Registry components in your prototype just as you can with the GOV.UK ones.

Example code can be found in the [components](/components/) section.
