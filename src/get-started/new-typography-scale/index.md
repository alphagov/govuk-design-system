The GOV.UK Design System team have been working on updating our typography scale provided with GOV.UK Frontend. This new scale is now available to use and will be enforced by default in GOV.UK Frontend version 6.0.0. Here's how to use it, what's changed and what to expect when implementing it into your service.

## Changes we've made
The new typography scale includes the following changes from the previous scale:

{{ govukTable({
    caption: "Changes to the typography scale",
    captionClasses: "govuk-table__caption--m",
    head: [
        {
            text: "Typography scale value"
        },
        {
            text: "Change"
        }
    ],
    rows: [
        [
            {
                text: "14"
            },
            {
                text: "Deprecated as a scale value and will be removed in GOV.UK Frontend version 6.0.0"
            }
        ],
        [
            {
                text: "16"
            },
            {
                text: "16px across all screen sizes and no longer drops to 14px on small screens"
            }
        ],
        [
            {
                text: "19"
            },
            {
                text: "19px across all screen sizes and no longer drops to 16px on small screens"
            }
        ],
        [
            {
                text: "24"
            },
            {
                text: "21px instead of 18px on small screens, plus line height adjustment"
            }
        ],
        [
            {
                text: "27"
            },
            {
                text: "21px instead of 18px on small screens, plus line height adjustment"
            }
        ],
        [
            {
                text: "36"
            },
            {
                text: "27px instead of 24px on small screens, plus line height adjustment"
            }
        ]
    ]
}) }}

## How to use the new typography scale
You can opt into the new scale by setting the feature flag variable `$govuk-new-typography-scale` at the root of your service's Sass to `true`:

```scss
$govuk-new-typography-scale: true;
```

This will automatically use the new typography scale. You don't need to change any of your Sass to use the new scale.

{{ govukWarningText({
  text: "Please be aware that this is an early release of the new typography scale. We may release significant changes to the scale in releases between now and GOV.UK Frontend 6.0.0. Please read version release notes to see if you are affected."
}) }}

## Testing your service against the new typography scale
If your service is using bespoke elements made using GOV.UK Frontend eg: bespoke components or specific page templates, you should test your service against the new typography scale to assess if any adjustments are required. Some key things to look for are:

- Spacing. Your bespoke elements may now appear squashed with increased font sizes on small screens.
- Specific positioning values. For example an absolutely positioned element. These values may need to be adjusted
