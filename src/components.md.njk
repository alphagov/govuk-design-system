Components are reusable parts of the user interface. You can use the individual components in different patterns and contexts.

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) where possible
- create new or adapt GOV.UK components only when you can demonstrate that GOV.UK ones do not work in your context
- be sharing new and adapted components with the community

Tell us what components you need so we prioritise getting them published.

## Non GOV.UK Design System components

Different components may be needed on HM Land Registry services and products depending on what domain they sit in and what kind of service it is.

### HM Land Registry Design System components

Use HM Land Registry Design System components if your service is internal, such as a caseworking or admin system.

You should speak to designers working on casework systems, as they are documenting components and advice.

## GOV.UK design components

Use GOV.UK design components if your service is all of the following:
- public-facing
- transactional
- sits on a gov.uk or service.gov.uk domain

You should:
- use [GOV.UK Design System styles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/)
- speak to our designers who work on GOV.UK services for any HM Land Registry adaptations

## Components being worked on

Components that have been identified as needed in more than one service in production.


### How to get involved

Talk to the design system steering group to:
- get access to the components documentation we have
- find out how you can help
- get advice on what to do if you think you have a new component, or need one
